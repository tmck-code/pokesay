## Usage

Just pipe some text! e.g.

```shell
echo yolo | pokesay
```

To see it every time you open a terminal, add it to your `.bashrc` file!   
_(This requires that you have `fortune` installed)_

```shell
echo 'fortune | pokesay' >> $HOME/.bashrc
```

> _Note: The pokesay tool is intended to only be used with piped text input from STDIN, entering text by typing (or other methods) might not work as expected!_

 -u, --unicode-borders
                    use unicode characters to draw the border around the speech

 -v, --verbose      print verbose output
 -W, --no-wrap      disable text wrapping (fastest)
 -w, --width=value  the max speech bubble width [80]
```

### Examples

  ```
- Print a message with a specific pokemon category and name

## How it works

This project extends on the original `fortune | cowsay`, a simple command combo that can be added to
your .bashrc to give you a random message spoken by a cow every time you open a new shell.

```
 ‚òØ ~ fortune | cowsay

```

As a personal project, this has been lovingly over-engineered with a focus on the lowest latency possible, so that it doesn't slow down your terminal experience.

1. These pokemon sprites used here are sourced from the awesome repo
[msikma/pokesprite](https://github.com/msikma/pokesprite)

    ![sprits](https://github.com/msikma/pokesprite/raw/master/resources/images/banner_gen8_2x.png)

2. All of these sprites are converted into a form that can be rendered in a terminal (unicode
characters and colour control sequences) by the `img2xterm` tool, found at
[rossy/img2xterm](https://github.com/rossy/img2xterm)

3. Use some go tools (`encoding/gob` and `go:embed`) to generate a go source code file
that encodes all of the converted unicode sprites as gzipped text and some search-optimised data structures.

4. Finally, this is built with the main CLI logic in `pokesay.go` into an single executable that can be
easily popped into a directory in the user's `$PATH`

If all you are after is installing the program to use, then there are no dependencies required!
Navigate to the Releases and download the latest binary.

## TODO

- **In progress**
  - [ ] optionally print ID assigned to each pokemon, support deterministic selection via the same ID
- **Short-term**
- [ ] requesting mew returns mewtwo also
- [ ] create "vertical" friendly display mode, place the Pokemon standing beside the text box, on the left or right
- [ ] create Debian package
- [ ] create Arch package
- **Longer-term**
  - [ ] make the process async.
    - (Currently the searching/pokemon fetching is done _before_ any printing begins. There's an opportunity to start printing the speech bubble while also fetching the pokemon to print below it)
    - [ ] implement native lolcat/rainbow HR/colour
- **In Beta**
- [x] add option to flip Pokemon to face right or left, remove all "right" facing cowfiles
- **Completed**
  - [x] support long and short cli args (e.g. --name/-n)
  - [x] Make the category struct faster to load - currently takes up to 80% of the execution time
  - [x] Store metadata and names in a more storage-efficient manner
  - [x] Import japanese names from data/pokemon.json
  - [x] Fix bad whitespace stripping when building assets
  - [x] List all names
  - [x] Make data structure to hold categories, names and pokemon
  - [x] Increase speed
  - [x] Improve categories to be more specific than shiny/regular
  - [x] Filter by both name and category
